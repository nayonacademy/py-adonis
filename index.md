### Prerequisites
This is not a beginner course. It's designed for the advanced-beginner -- someone with at least six months of web development experience. Before beginning, you should have some familiarity with the following topics. Refer to these resources for more info:

| Topic      | Resource |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| Docker      | Get started with Docker Compose       |
| Docker Compose   | Text        |
| Framework  |  TDD, Developing Web Applications with Python own framework |


### What will you learn?
### Part 1
In this first part, you'll learn how to develop a RESTful API Web framework build with Python and Postgres. You'll containerize this framework and Postgres to run inside Docker containers and configure pytest in order to practice Test-Driven Development (TDD).

### Part 2
In the second part, you'll start by deploying py-adonis framework, Gunicorn, and Postgres to Heroku with Docker. You'll then continue building out the RESTful API as you write unit and integration tests. Finally, we'll look at how to document the API with Swagger.
